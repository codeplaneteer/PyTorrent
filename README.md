# War
The classic game of War! 
First it will ask for player 1's name, then player 2's name.
Then press any key except q | Q (this is end the game) to battle it out!
When you are done with your game, then press q | Q to see how got the most wins, and is the ultimate Winner! 
There are only 52 cards in a deck, so if you play them all the game will end as well.
Good Luck!
